_A Quote_

> ICO tools should be available for non-coders for free. Raising funds from a crowd is our basic human right.

Token Wizard is a tool to create token and crowdsale contracts in five simple steps. Wizard is based on TokenMarket contracts. Wizard is baked how we like it: decentralized, client side, serverless, open source, free, awesome.

ICOs usually have two or more contracts. One token contract and one or more crowdsale contract plus supplemental contracts, e.g., safe math, pricing strategy, etc. Most token contracts are the same (ERC-20); most crowdsale contracts are different. Token implementation should be stable for compatibility, and it is crucial to connect token to exchanges and wallets. Crowdsale contracts on another side should follow fashion and differentiate a project from others, e.g., create a new type of FOMO, fear of missing out.

This tool is free to use and open source.
